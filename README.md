For this introductory project I was in charge of integrating the interface of a website that allows users to find accommodation and activities in the city of their choice, with HTML and CSS code.
I was given :
- the website mockups, 
- a summary note for Booki site integration, and 
- a code base to begin.

The intended lessons were :
 1) Learning how to structure a page using HTML
 2) Understanding the connection between HTML and CSS 
 3) Learning about importing (fonts, libraries, etc.)
 4) Devoloping the knowledge of creating simple animations via CSS (ex: enlarging the text of a link when hover the cursor over the text)
